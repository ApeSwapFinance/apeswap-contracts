## `Math`



Standard math utilities missing in the Solidity language.


### `max(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the largest of two numbers.

### `min(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the smallest of two numbers.

### `average(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the average of two numbers. The result is rounded towards
zero.

### `ceilDiv(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the ceiling of the division of two numbers.

This differs from standard division with `/` in that it rounds up instead
of rounding down.
