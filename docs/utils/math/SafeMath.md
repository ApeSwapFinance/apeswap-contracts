## `SafeMath`



Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations.

NOTE: `SafeMath` is no longer needed starting with Solidity 0.8. The compiler
now has built in overflow checking.


### `tryAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) → bool, uint256` (internal)



Returns the addition of two unsigned integers, with an overflow flag.

_Available since v3.4._

### `trySub(uint256 a, uint256 b) → bool, uint256` (internal)



Returns the substraction of two unsigned integers, with an overflow flag.

_Available since v3.4._

### `tryMul(uint256 a, uint256 b) → bool, uint256` (internal)



Returns the multiplication of two unsigned integers, with an overflow flag.

_Available since v3.4._

### `tryDiv(uint256 a, uint256 b) → bool, uint256` (internal)



Returns the division of two unsigned integers, with a division by zero flag.

_Available since v3.4._

### `tryMod(uint256 a, uint256 b) → bool, uint256` (internal)



Returns the remainder of dividing two unsigned integers, with a division by zero flag.

_Available since v3.4._

### `add(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the addition of two unsigned integers, reverting on
overflow.

Counterpart to Solidity's `+` operator.

Requirements:

- Addition cannot overflow.

### `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the subtraction of two unsigned integers, reverting on
overflow (when the result is negative).

Counterpart to Solidity's `-` operator.

Requirements:

- Subtraction cannot overflow.

### `mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the multiplication of two unsigned integers, reverting on
overflow.

Counterpart to Solidity's `*` operator.

Requirements:

- Multiplication cannot overflow.

### `div(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the integer division of two unsigned integers, reverting on
division by zero. The result is rounded towards zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `/` operator.

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

### `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the remainder of dividing two unsigned integers. (unsigned integer modulo),
reverting when dividing by zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `%` operator. This function uses a `revert`
opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity uses an
invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

### `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the subtraction of two unsigned integers, reverting with custom message on
overflow (when the result is negative).

CAUTION: This function is deprecated because it requires allocating memory for the error
message unnecessarily. For custom revert reasons use {trySub}.

Counterpart to Solidity's `-` operator.

Requirements:

- Subtraction cannot overflow.

### `div(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the integer division of two unsigned integers, reverting with custom message on
division by zero. The result is rounded towards zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `/` operator. Note: this function uses a
`revert` opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity
uses an invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

### `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256` (internal)



Returns the remainder of dividing two unsigned integers. (unsigned integer modulo),
reverting with custom message when dividing by zero.

CAUTION: This function is deprecated because it requires allocating memory for the error
message unnecessarily. For custom revert reasons use {tryMod}.

Counterpart to Solidity's `%` operator. This function uses a `revert`
opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity uses an
invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.
