## `ERC3156FlashBorrowerMock`



WARNING: this IERC3156FlashBorrower mock implementation is for testing purposes ONLY.
Writing a secure flash lock borrower is not an easy task, and should be done with the utmost care.
This is not an example of how it should be done, and no pattern present in this mock should be considered secure.
Following best practices, always have your contract properly audited before using them to manipulate important funds on
live networks.
