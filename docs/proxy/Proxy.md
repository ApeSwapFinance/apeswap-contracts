## `Proxy`



This abstract contract provides a fallback function that delegates all calls to another contract using the EVM
instruction `delegatecall`. We refer to the second contract as the _implementation_ behind the proxy, and it has to
be specified by overriding the virtual {_implementation} function.

Additionally, delegation to the implementation can be triggered manually through the {_fallback} function, or to a
different contract through the {_delegate} function.

The success and return data of the delegated call will be returned back to the caller of the proxy.


### `_delegate(address implementation)` (internal)



Delegates the current call to `implementation`.

This function does not return to its internall call site, it will return directly to the external caller.

### `_implementation() â†’ address` (internal)



This is a virtual function that should be overriden so it returns the address to which the fallback function
and {_fallback} should delegate.

### `_fallback()` (internal)



Delegates the current call to the address returned by `_implementation()`.

This function does not return to its internall call site, it will return directly to the external caller.

### `fallback()` (external)



Fallback function that delegates calls to the address returned by `_implementation()`. Will run if no other
function in the contract matches the call data.

### `receive()` (external)



Fallback function that delegates calls to the address returned by `_implementation()`. Will run if call data
is empty.

### `_beforeFallback()` (internal)



Hook that is called before falling back to the implementation. Can happen as part of a manual `_fallback`
call, or as part of the Solidity `fallback` or `receive` functions.

If overriden should call `super._beforeFallback()`.
