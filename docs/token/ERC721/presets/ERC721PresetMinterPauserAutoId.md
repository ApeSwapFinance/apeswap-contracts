## `ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId`



{ERC721} token, including:

 - ability for holders to burn (destroy) their tokens
 - a minter role that allows for token minting (creation)
 - a pauser role that allows to stop all token transfers
 - token ID and URI autogeneration

This contract uses {AccessControl} to lock permissioned functions using the
different roles - head to its documentation for details.

The account that deploys the contract will be granted the minter and pauser
roles, as well as the default admin role, which will let it grant both minter
and pauser roles to other accounts.


### `constructor(string name, string symbol, string baseTokenURI)` (public)



Grants `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `MINTER_ROLE` and `PAUSER_ROLE` to the
account that deploys the contract.

Token URIs will be autogenerated based on `baseURI` and their token IDs.
See {ERC721-tokenURI}.

### `_baseURI() → string` (internal)





### `mint(address to)` (public)



Creates a new token for `to`. Its token ID will be automatically
assigned (and available on the emitted {IERC721-Transfer} event), and the token
URI autogenerated based on the base URI passed at construction.

See {ERC721-_mint}.

Requirements:

- the caller must have the `MINTER_ROLE`.

### `pause()` (public)



Pauses all token transfers.

See {ERC721Pausable} and {Pausable-_pause}.

Requirements:

- the caller must have the `PAUSER_ROLE`.

### `unpause()` (public)



Unpauses all token transfers.

See {ERC721Pausable} and {Pausable-_unpause}.

Requirements:

- the caller must have the `PAUSER_ROLE`.

### `_beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` (internal)





### `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) → bool` (public)



See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.
